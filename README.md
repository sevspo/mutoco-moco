Hello Mutoco

For this application I decided to use SvelteKit.
It's a small prototype to showcase some of my skills.
It's also my first application with this Framework and I must say I am very pleased with de DEV experience so far.

### Starting the Project

Clone, install and

```
npm run dev

```

I bet you know the drill

Bye and enjoy 😁🙏✌
